> # Advice
> This is just a side project aimed to help me create and update resume easily. I strongly feel that you should not use this to for your resume. Reason being:
> - The resume PDFs generated by this project do not have the proper structure that a resume PDF made from latex or word document has. It is not good for ATS (Applicant Tracking System). 
> - The resume size is very large (~300kb)
> 
> >I Personally do not use this project anymore to generate my resume.

# Two Column Resume Generator

A one-page, two asymmetric column HTML CSS resume template created by using React that caters particularly to an undergraduate student to serve his/her Technical interview resume.

OpenFonts - The Project uses free, open-source fonts:-

- Lato (and its various variants)

- Raleway.

## Motivation

A lot of companies today search resumes based on keywords but at the same time require/prefer a one-page resume, especially for undergraduates.

This template attempts to look clean, highlight details and be a single page.
