# ashuvssut-resume

A one-page, two asymmetric column HTML CSS resume template created by using React that caters particularly to an undergraduate student to serve his/her Technical interview resume.

OpenFonts - The Project uses free, open-source fonts:-

- Lato (and its various variants)

- Raleway.

## Motivation

A lot of companies today search resumes based on keywords but at the same time require/prefer a one-page resume, especially for undergraduates.

This template attempts to look clean, highlight details and be a single page.
